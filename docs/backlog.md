# Backlog — open items by spec

Single index of **open** work across every spec in `docs/specs/`. Each item
names the spec, the Acceptance Criterion (where one applies), what's blocking
it, and how it gets unblocked. Closed/shipped work is **not** kept here — see
each spec's Changelog and [`product/changelog.md`](product/changelog.md).

This is the tactical **backlog**: per-instance, no pack-side source after first
install — it's yours to curate. It is distinct from the **product roadmap**
(strategy, not a work index) at [`product/roadmap.md`](product/roadmap.md).
"Roadmap" = direction; "backlog" = the work/deferral index.

Deferred acceptance criteria point here by **anchor**: a spec criterion written
`- [ ] <outcome> (deferred: <anchor>)` means `<anchor>` resolves to a heading in
this file (GitHub heading-slug rules — lowercase, spaces become hyphens). The
deferral lives here, version-controlled and greppable, not in a PR comment that
rots. See `CONVENTIONS.md` § 4 (Spec metadata contract).

## How this file is maintained

- Every spec records its own `Status:` field and `Acceptance Criteria`
  checkboxes. This file aggregates the **open** items so they're visible in one
  place — it is not the source of truth.
- When an AC closes or a spec ships, update the spec first, then **remove** the
  now-closed item here in the same change (closed work lives in the spec
  Changelog / `product/changelog.md`, not here).
- When a new spec lands with open ACs, add a section here.
- If an item here is no longer accurate against the underlying spec, trust the
  spec and fix this file.

## diagram-consistency-system

- **Discovered (not an AC deferral): style-gallery mock HTML variable-naming drift.**
  The mock decks under `ppt-output/style-gallery/*.html` use an ad-hoc CSS-variable
  vocabulary (`--accent`, `--bg-base`, `--line-soft`, `--display-font`) instead of
  the canonical set the real pipeline injects from `style.json`
  (`--accent-1..4`, `--card-bg-from/to`, `--font-primary`; see
  `page-html-playbook.md` Phase 6). Diagram recipes correctly target the canonical
  set, so they theme correctly under the real pipeline but render low-contrast if
  fed a gallery mock's `:root`. Out of scope for this spec (diagrams + QA + §E
  contradiction). Unblocked by a follow-up that regenerates the gallery mocks
  against the canonical variable set, or documents the mocks as non-canonical.
- **Discovered (not an AC deferral): planning `chart_refs` never resolve, so planning
  smoke fixtures fail at baseline.** `planning_validator.resource_exists` looks up a
  `chart_refs` value as a per-name file (`references/charts/<chart_type>.md`), but chart
  recipes live in *grouped* files (`references/charts/{basic,advanced,complex}.md`), so
  any planning packet carrying `chart_refs` / `resource_ref.chart` fails resolution —
  which is why `smoke_skill.py`'s `planning-validator-{low,mid-low,high,dashboard}` cases
  are red at baseline (independent of the outline/style failures). The
  `reference-runbook-archetype` planning fixtures work around this with a `chart_free()`
  helper. Unblocked by teaching `resource_exists` to resolve a `chart_type` against the
  grouped recipe files (e.g. an index), then dropping `chart_free`.

## claude-design-absorption

- **Follow-up: regenerate PNG thumbnails for the two new styles + refresh the hero composites.**
  The existing styles ship committed `<style_id>.png` thumbnails and category `hero-*.png`
  composites; the two new styles have HTML mocks only (gallery tiles render from the HTML
  iframe, so the gallery index is correct), and `hero-all.png` / `hero-light-premium.png` still
  render the old tile set (and their README alt-text still reads the old per-category counts).
  Unblocked by `python3 scripts/gallery.py --screenshots` + `python3 scripts/build_hero.py`
  where puppeteer is available. (Visual QA of the 5 new recipes + 2 mocks and the post-diff
  adversarial review were completed in the authoring session — both clean.)

## reference-runbook-page-types

- **Discovered (not an AC deferral): `smoke_skill.py` pre-existing fixture drift.**
  <a name="smoke-skill-pre-existing-fixture-drift"></a>`scripts/smoke_skill.py`
  exits non-zero on `main` (independent of the reference-runbook page_type work —
  verified by running it against the pre-change tree): its fixtures + the
  `tpl-style-phase1` invocation reference files that no longer exist —
  `references/charts/kpi.md` / `references/charts/metric-row.md` (charts were
  consolidated into `basic.md` / `advanced.md` / `complex.md`) and
  `references/styles/runtime-style-rules.md` (also referenced at
  `references/cli-cheatsheet.md:275`; no `runtime-*` file exists under
  `references/styles/`). The `reference-runbook-page-types` change adds **zero**
  net-new `smoke_skill` failures and its own new-type router assertions pass.
  Out of scope for that spec (unrelated chart/style file structure). Unblocked by
  a follow-up that regenerates the smoke fixtures + `cli-cheatsheet` against the
  current `charts/` and `styles/` file set (or restores the missing files).

- **Discovered (not an AC deferral): `page_type` value-set duplicated across seven
  sites with no shared constant.** The planning `page_type` enum is copy-pasted
  across three Python modules (`planning_validator.VALID_PAGE_TYPES`,
  `contract_validator.NON_DASHBOARD_PAGE_TYPES` + the `validate_html` chrome set,
  `visual_qa` + `smoke_skill` header/footer sets) plus two playbooks and
  `references/prompts.md` — see [[ppt-page-type-enum-consumers]]. Every enum edit
  re-runs the same seven-site drift risk. Unblocked by exporting `VALID_PAGE_TYPES`
  (and the chrome-required subset) from `planning_validator` and importing it into
  `contract_validator` / `visual_qa` / `smoke_skill`, collapsing three of the seven
  code sites to one. Out of scope for `reference-runbook-page-types` (which added
  both values to every site in lockstep as the spec's *Always do* demanded).

## persistent-chrome-flag

- **Follow-up (not an AC deferral): mechanical list-completeness check for the persistent_chrome excluded-literal set.**
  `design-runtime/design-specs.md` §A hand-copies the 6 group-C sample literals it forbids
  (`SCHEMATIC · DELIVERY RUNBOOK` … `2.4 · 2026`) from `blocks/worksheet.md` group C. If a
  future edit adds/renames a masthead/footer literal in the recipe, that list silently goes
  stale. Today the leak is prevented structurally — the §A copy-slot mapping fills *every*
  masthead (3) + footer (3-col) slot from `deck_chrome` + per-page fields, so the pasted
  literals are always overwritten — making the prohibition list belt-and-suspenders. Unblocked
  by a small goal-based check (extract the quoted literals from worksheet.md group-C
  masthead+footer, assert each appears in the §A 禁用清单) added to `lint_diagram_recipes.py`
  or a standalone one-liner. Raised by the quality-engineer diff pass (2026-07-01); deferred as
  polish, not a shipping bug in an off-by-default flag.
